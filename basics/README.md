Learning the basic of PyTorch

After spending way way to much time learning tensorflow / keras. This will be a small collection of examples form pytorch.org to brush up on the difference. I also know very little of whats under the hood of deep learning.

Ill more than likely pivate to NLP examples once the basic are done.
